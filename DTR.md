##Project: Idea Box

##Group Member Names: Travis Gee, Eric Weissman

##Project Expectations: What does each group member hope to get out of this project? 
* Eric: I want to get a better understanding of creating and working with objects. I want to get more experience with working with the DOM and objects in a more real-world, application based scenario.

* Travis: Working with someone different and collaborating where we can finish the project to the point where we are aiming for and to leave with a solid understanding of what and why we did what we did. 

## Goals and expectations:
* Ideally, complete all facets of the project including extensions. 
Emphasis on driver-navigator while working together (in-person) with clear expectations/communication set for completing smaller chunks individually.

* Devote time and resources to reviewing individual work prior to starting drive-navigate. 

##Team strengths:
* Communication and setting expectations. 
* Work ethic and time management,
* Solid teaching and instruction. 

##How to overcome obstacles:
* Emphasis on communicating what you are thinking and erring on the side of overcommunication.

* Being proactive - wireframing, psuedocoding, etc. before just diving in. 

* Staying connected by reviewing that rubric and checklist. 

##Schedule Expectations (When are we available to work together and individually?):
*Earlier in mornings, with the understanding that one/both of us may pair with someone else around 8am.

* Sundays are a no-go. 

* Try to protect later evenings, ideally leave Turing around 7-8ish. 

##Communication Expectations (How and often will we communicate? How do we keep lines of communication open?):
* As needed. Don't hestitate to reach out (via Slack, or call if necessary). Better to know about it and figure out what to do, rather than be surprised. 

##Abilities Expectations (Technical strengths and areas for desired improvement):
* Eric: I feel strongest with HTML and CSS - want to have opportunities to drive/navigate with more of the advanced JS reuqirements. 

* Travis: Wants more reps with CSS, but want reps with everything. 

##Workload Expectations (What features do we each want to work on?):
* Be flexible, work on one piece at time and be proactive about what we should be working on, when. 

##Workflow Expectations (Git workflow/Tools/Code Review/Reviewing Pull Requests):
* More branches focused on one specific feature/issues addressed. Multiple commits (keep around 5ish?) before pushing branches.

##Expectations for giving and receiving feedback:
* 2-3 minute mini-retros to evaluate each working session and determine ways to improve.
